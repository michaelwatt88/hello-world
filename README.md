# hello-world
Hello! You all are amazing.


Hi, my name is Mike. I live in Orlando,FL, am a father to five boys, and teach high schools. I love kids, and I love teaching but I need a job that allows me to feed my kids and still have money to buy food. This is why I am switching careers. Thank you Lambda School for making this a possibility.
